    "# Exploratory Data Analysis Exercise with Pandas and HoloViews\n",

    "\n",
    "After performing data cleaning and time-series alignment with Pandas (you can copy the exact code used in the Matplotlib exercise), you will transition develop interactaive HoloViews visualizations. The core of the assignment emphasizes the HoloViews philosophy and leveraging the Matplotlib backend, encouring interactive exploratory data analysis to link, overlay, and explore discharge trends across Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming.\n",

In addition to these locations, ensure you have at least **2 sites in Idaho, 2 sites in Wyoming, and 2 sites in Utah.** \n",
